    "1. *Reading the encoder position is something that cannot be done with regular servos. Why is this? Why is it important to be able to do this?*\n",
    "\n",
    "    An encoder is a generic term for something that encode i.e. measures something else. The encoder position is a sensor which turns a servo position into an electronic signal. In the case of high-end servo motors, it usually refers to optical encoders (disc-type). Toy servos use a simple potentiometer, and high-quality/industrial servo motors use hall effect sensors (amongst other things).\n",

    "    It is important to be able to provide a measurement to the controller i.e. computer so that it can correct for any undesirable behaviour \n",

    "2. *Look at the Control Table Address part of the code (lines 28-30). Note how each command name corresponds to a number. These numbers are variables of the actuator that are stored in local memory (within the actuator). The complete control table can be found on the online documentation for the XM430-W350 actuator.*\n",
